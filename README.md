# Event Calendar

This project uses the React JS framework in an app that allows users to create and save events on a broswer viewable calendar. 
You can make a new event to keep track of by clicking the "Add Event" button or by clicking a date on the calendar, which will automatically fill the date section.
The calendar is saved locally in the browser using LocalStorage.
